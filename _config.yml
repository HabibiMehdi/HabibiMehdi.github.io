about_content: |
  Hello! I am Mehdi Habibi, a **machine learning** and **signal processing engineer** with a deep commitment to advancing interpretable, scalable algorithms for real-world applications.
  My background bridges **electrical engineering** and **computational neuroscience**, with experience developing and applying advanced optimization **(Python, Matlab)**, deep learning **(Pytorch)**, decoding neural signal methods.
  My research and engineering work have focused on developing innovative frameworks for neural signal**(spike/LFPs/ EEGs)** analysis related to the kinematic and kinetic aspects of movement control, complemented by a solid knowledge of **rodent models**, **experimental task design**, and surgical procedures, particularly in the context of electrophysiological recordings. In addition, I have practical expertise in **FPGA-based systems**, which allows me to integrate advanced computational methods with real-time applications in experimental neuroscience.
