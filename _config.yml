  Hello! I am **Mehdi Habibi**, a **Machine Learning** and **Signal Processing Engineer** dedicated to developing interpretable and efficient algorithms for real-world neuroscience and biomedical challenges.  
  My background bridges **Electrical Engineering** and **Computational Neuroscience**, focusing on neural decoding, optimization algorithms (**Python, MATLAB**), and deep learning architectures (**PyTorch**).  
  I specialize in analyzing neural signals (**LFPs, ECoGs, EEGs**) related to movement control, supported by strong experience in **rodent behavioral experiments**, **surgical recording setups**, and **experimental task design**.  
  Additionally, I have hands-on expertise in **FPGA-based systems**, integrating advanced computational approaches with real-time neuroscience experiments.
